Delhi, Haryana, and Uttar Pradesh show inadequate efforts in phasing out such vehicles. Enhancing public transport and e-mobility infrastructure is urgently needed. An FIR has been filed against Alt News co-founder Mohammad Zubair for allegedly inciting protests against Dasna Devi temple priest Yati Narsinghanand. Zubair's posts allegedly led to a demonstration, prompting police to impose prohibitory orders. The charges against Zubair include promoting enmity and defamation. Ten protesters were arrested amid heightened security and tension in Ghaziabad. Ghaziabad police arrested a 19-year-old after a gunfight for allegedly raping a 7-year-old girl during a Ramlila event in Nandgram. The youth had taken the girl on the pretext of buying ice cream. He assaulted her and threatened to kill her. The victim was later found unconscious with injuries and is currently receiving care at home. Trial runs have commenced for the Namo Bharat train on the 12km Delhi-Ghaziabad-Meerut RRTS corridor segment from Sahibabad to New Ashok Nagar. With three new Delhi stations nearing completion and advanced evaluations planned, this infrastructure boosts commuter convenience, integrating multiple transit modes.

Utilizing FASTag data and the Vahan database, authorities will identify and e-challan vehicles without valid fitness and pollution certificates. Initially, this will target vehicles at Delhi’s 52 entry points and may expand nationwide. Despite significant reductions in farm fires, the Commission for Air Quality Management warns that overaged vehicles in Delhi and NCR exacerbate pollution. Delhi, Haryana, and Uttar Pradesh show inadequate efforts in phasing out such vehicles. Enhancing public transport and e-mobility infrastructure is urgently needed. Delhi's air quality deteriorated with an AQI of 292, approaching 'very poor' levels. Key pollutants include PM10 and PM2.5, mainly from transportation. Neighbouring regions also contribute significantly to the pollution. Expected further worsening due to unfavorable meteorological conditions and additional emissions from stubble burning. BJP won 5 out of 6 seats in Faridabad, with key victories in constituencies like Tigaon and Badkhal. Civic issues were a major concern during the campaign, but efforts by Amit Shah and Yogi Adityanath aided BJP's success. Congress won only one seat in Prithla. Rahul Gandhi's farmer-focused campaign failed to resonate with the urban electorate."},

Governor R N Ravi faced backlash for omitting 'Dravida' from Tamil Thaai Vaazhthu during a Hindi event, igniting criticism from various political leaders. Participating in Tamil University’s convocation, Ravi stood up for the original version. Leaders accused him of creating controversies for attention, while discussions on language policies and spirituality in politics ensued. The India Meteorological Department forecasts the onset of the northeast monsoon over southeast India around Oct 15-16, with Chennai and neighboring districts expected to receive significant rainfall.

Housemates collectively decided to vote the actor out after his aggressive fight with fellow contestant Chum Darang. Over the years, the actor has made headlines several times. Here’s all that you need to know about him:- Avinash Mishra is an emerging Indian television actor known for his versatile performances and charming presence on screen. He made his acting debut in 2017 with the series Sethji, where he portrayed the character Bajirao, quickly gaining recognition for his talent. Following this, he starred in Pyaar Tune Kya Kiya and gained further popularity with his role in Yeh Rishtey Hain Pyaar Ke. Born on December 9, 1995, in Raipur, Chhattisgarh, Avinash has carved a niche for himself in the industry with his compelling performances and relatable personality, garnering a dedicated fanbase and making headlines for his work and philanthropic efforts. Avinash Mishra's journey in Bigg Boss 18 came to an unexpected end when he was asked to leave the house immediately following a heated physical altercation with fellow contestant Chum Darang. Incident Details The controversy began when Chum Darang allegedly used a derogatory term to address Avinash, sparking a fierce argument between the two contestants. The situation escalated rapidly, leading to a physical confrontation. Avinash Mishra has been subject to relationship rumors, particularly with his co-stars Vrushika Mehta and Kaveri Priyam. However, the actress later denied the claims and said in an interview, \"That wasn’t true either, and I had clarified it back then. We shared great onscreen chemistry, and after working together for around two years, we became good friends. So, we used to spend time together and chill both on and off set. But some people just love creating stories about two co-actors.\" Avinash Mishra is a television actor who launched his acting career in 2017 with the series Sethji, where he portrayed the character Bajirao. That same year, he also appeared in Pyaar Tune Kya Kiya, alongside Jiya Shankar. Born on December 9, 1995, in Raipur, Chhattisgarh, Avinash has quickly made a name for himself in the television industry. Avinash Mishra's television career tookto another level with breakthrough role as Shantanu in the \"Yeh Teri Galiyan\" in 2018. The show, set in Kolkata's red-light district, explored themes of love, family, and social issues. Avinash's portrayal of Shantanu, a young and passionate character, earned him recognition and praise from audiences. His on-screen chemistry with co-star Vrushika Mehta was particularly appreciated. Avinash Mishra, who played the lead in Nath - Zevar Ya Zanjeer, bid adieu to the show. The actor had joined the show in February after Arjit Taneja quit.

Applying mehendi on an auspicious occasion can also protect the wearer from evil. Mehendi designs are looked upon on the occasions of Indian festivals, pujas, and weddings. As we have the one-day Karwa Chauth fast around the corner, every married woman gets ready to apply the most beautiful mehendi and complete the look with stunning jewellery and a sari. As there are multiple mehendi designs and styles in the market, let’s choose from the best and draw some inspiration for the final look. Arabic mehendi style is one of the most popular types of mehendi designs which include an enchanting mix of floral and geometric patterns and create a statement look. While traditionally, the Indian designs cover our whole palm, Arabic designs are less intricate and cover the wrists and the back of our hands mainly. It has its roots in Persia, where soon the trend took all over the Arab countries and got its name. (Image Credits: Pinterest) Traditional Indian mehendi designs call for new beginnings or for an auspicious event. These designs consist of detailed meshwork patterns with flowers and intricate patterns that look beautiful and cover the whole palm and back of the hand. The Indian mehendi design got its inspiration from Egypt, and since the 4th century, henna designs were spotted in the Deccan regions in several caves which has become an important part of our culture.  (Image Credits: Pinterest) Bridal or jewellery mehendi designs applied on brides appear like jewellery which have intricate designs of flowers, petals, and leaves. Bridal mehendi designs mainly cover your full hands, arms, and legs, and hold a strong importance during wedding ceremonies. Many Indian brides also cover half of their legs and feet with intricate mehendi designs on their wedding grabbing the spotlight which makes them stand out of the crowd and look gorgeous on their wedding day. (Image Credits: Pinterest) The Moroccan mehendi style is mainly popular in the Middle East Gulf countries which look more simple and subtle but are very fine and properly laid. The style takes a more contemporary take and looks trendy, unique, and chic with small rounds and shapes that have intricate detailing around making your hands look subtle but stylish. The diamond-shaped mehendi design is very common in the Moroccan style and is their main feature.  (Image Credits: Pinterest) Originating from West Africa, mehendi designs were mainly ruled out by the ancient tribal communities and were inspired by their life events. African henna soon took over the world and is known as Lalle. Their drawings and designs are quite similar to the Arabic mehendi design and have enough space and gaps, unlike the Indian mehendi designs that are known for their intricate detailing. African designs also include a lot of tribal patterns that are related to their culture and come with bold borders and lines.

Today, that love has guided us through all the challenges and triumphs, leading up to this moment, where, with the blessings of both our families and gods, we are now man and wife. Here’s to love, hope, and all things beautiful with each other, from now until forever.” Karva Chauth 2024 Live: Origin of this auspicious festival One of the oldest mentions of Karwa Chauth is in the Hindu epic 'Mahabharata'.The story of Queen Veervati, who once kept a fast for her husband, is a popularly associated with the festival. According to the story, Queen Veervati once observed a fast on Karwa Chauth to pray for her husband's longevity and good health. The word ‘Karwa’ means an earthen pot, and ‘Chauth’ means the fourth. To put the ‘Karwa’ in perspective, women offer ‘Argya’ to the moon using an earthen pot on the fourth day of Kartik month. Karwa Chauth is thus celebrated on the fourth day of Kartik in the Hindu lunar calendar, and according to the English calendar it falls anywhere between October and November. Karva Chauth 2024 Live: Breaking the Fast After the moon rituals, the husband offers his wife the first sip of water and a bite of food, which marks the official breaking of the fast. Many couples then enjoy a small meal together, often including traditional sweets and foods prepared for the occasion. Karwa Chauth 2024: Why women don’t directly view the moon rays on this auspicious day On Karwa Chauth, one of the most significant and unique rituals involves looking at the moon through a sieve rather than directly viewing its rays. This tradition is deeply rooted in symbolic beliefs, linking the moon’s rays to the well-being of married couples. According to ancient customs, the moon is believed to hold a special significance on this day, and its rays are said to have a profound influence, strengthening the bond between husband and wife. By viewing the moon through a sieve, women perform the ritual with respect, ensuring that both the moon and their marriage are protected from any negative influences. Additionally, the husband is often regarded as a symbol of the moon during this ritual. After gazing at the moon through the sieve, women traditionally look at their husbands the same way, reinforcing the sacred connection between the two. This practice emphasizes the importance of preserving sweetness, harmony, and love in their relationship. This ritual, though seemingly simple, carries layers of meaning, ensuring that the bond between married couples is safeguarded and nourished through faith and devotion on Karwa Chauth.

Karva Chauth 2024: The timeless stories that define the festival’s spiritual significance Karva Chauth, celebrated by married women across India, is not just about fasting for a husband’s long life. It’s a day deeply rooted in tradition, love, and unwavering commitment. A central part of this celebration is the storytelling aspect, where age-old tales, or kathas, are passed down through generations, reinforcing the deeper spiritual meaning of the festival. In 2024, as women observe the fast and gather for the rituals, these timeless stories continue to inspire. Narratives such as the tale of Queen Veeravati, whose devotion and prayers brought her husband back to life, and the story of Savitri and Satyavan, symbolizing the triumph of love over fate, form the core of Karva Chauth’s spiritual teachings. These kathas encapsulate themes of faith, sacrifice, and resilience, connecting the physical act of fasting to the emotional and spiritual devotion women demonstrate for their husbands. Across different regions of India, these stories may vary, but their underlying message of marital strength and love remains the same. For many families, sharing these stories is more than a tradition—it’s a way to pass on cultural values, reminding future generations of the power of love, prayer, and devotion. Whether recited during the puja or read as a group, these tales continue to bind families and communities, making the celebration of Karva Chauth a truly meaningful experience.

Karwa Chauth 2024: Romantic tips for long-distance couples to celebrate together Karwa Chauth is a cherished festival that symbolizes love and devotion in marriage. While it's traditionally celebrated with the wife fasting and the husband helping her break the fast by offering water and sweets, long-distance couples may feel disheartened being apart on this special day. However, even from afar, the spirit of Karwa Chauth can be kept alive with a little creativity and effort. Here are some romantic ways long-distance couples can celebrate the day together: Create a cute montage video Take a trip down memory lane by compiling candid photos, goofy moments, and video clips of each other. Edit them into a heartwarming video or slideshow, adding cute animations. Share the video over a video call to relive those special moments and feel close, even miles apart. Send surprise gifts Surprise your partner with a thoughtful gift. Peek into their wish list or choose something personal, like a custom pendant, photo frame, or personalized coffee mug. Coordinate deliveries so they arrive in time for the special day, adding an element of surprise and connection. Host a virtual watch party Pick a favorite movie or series that resonates with your relationship and watch it together through a virtual watch party. Keep your cameras on to see each other's reactions or chat during your favorite scenes, making the experience more intimate and engaging. Celebrate the moon viewing ritual online One of the most important Karwa Chauth rituals involves viewing the moon through a sieve, followed by looking at the husband. You can perform this ritual online via video call. To make it extra special, surprise your partner with a delivery of sweets and snacks after breaking the fast. Having something physical to share, even if from afar, can create a sense of closeness. Share a post-fast feast together After the fast is broken, dress up in coordinated festive outfits and enjoy a meal together over a video call. For a more immersive experience, try cooking the same dishes. Sharing a meal, even virtually, makes the distance feel less significant.

The night sky over Dubai erupts in a dazzling display of fireworks, celebrating a momentous occasion for New Zealand cricket.  The White Ferns, having previously fallen short in the 2009 and 2010 finals, have at last realized their long-held ambition and secured the coveted T20 World Cup title. Women's T20 World Cup Final Live Score: NEW ZEALAND win T20 World Cup New Zealand beat South Africa by 32 runs in the final to win maiden Women's T20 World Cup title Women's T20 World Cup Final Live Score: BOWLED! BOWLED! Rosemary Mair castles Sinalo Jafta for 6 runs. New Zealand are just one wicket away from winning their maiden T20 World Cup trophy. Women's T20 World Cup Final Live Score: WICKET! SA 8 down! WICKET! Rosemary Mair takes her second wicket. Another one bites the dust. Full on middle and leg. Tryon hammers it down the ground but Green takes an easy catch.  Women's T20 World Cup Final Live Score: WICKET! Kerr takes her third wicket! WICKET! Suzie Bates secures her third catch of the match, while Amelia Kerr claims her third wicket. The New Zealand Women's cricket team is in a commanding position and appears to be heading towards a victory. Women's T20 World Cup Final Live Score: WICKET! Luus gone! WICKET! Brooke Halliday dismisses Sune Luus for 8 runs. South Africa are 6 down now. Luus tries to smash but the ball hits the toe end of the bat. Suzie Bates takes an easy catch at short extra cover. New Zealand are celebrating. They are looking favourites from here.  Women's T20 World Cup Final Live Score: Welcome boundary for SA! FOUR! The South African team, known as the Proteas, celebrated a much-needed boundary. The bowler delivered a full-length delivery with good pace, targeting the stumps. Chloe Tryon, the batter, timed her shot perfectly and executed a lofted drive over the bowler's head, resulting in a fantastic four runs. Women's T20 World Cup Final Live Score: WICKET! De Klerk goes! WICKET! Rosemary Mair strikes in her first delivery of the over. Nadine de Klerk falls for 6 runs.  The New Zealand Women's cricket team is exuding confidence, believing that victory is within their grasp. In a pivotal moment, Rosemary Mair delivers a strategically paced delivery, utilizing her skills to execute a traditional off-cutter that pitches outside the off-stump. De Klerk, the batsman, attempts to capitalize on the opportunity with a forceful swing, but the outcome is less than ideal. The bat makes contact with the ball, resulting in a substantial outside edge that propels the ball directly towards Kerr, positioned at short third. Kerr, alert and ready, secures the catch with ease, further solidifying New Zealand's advantageous position in the match. Women's T20 World Cup Final Live Score: WICKET! Kapp departs! WICKET! Eden Carson dismisses Marizanne Kapp for 8 runs. Big big wicket for New Zealand at the moment. Kapp has been dismissed, leaving her team in a precarious position with half of their lineup back in the pavilion. The wicket fell when Eden Carson delivered a full-length delivery outside the off stump. Kapp attempted to play an aggressive sweep shot, getting down on one knee and making good contact with the ball.  However, she failed to generate sufficient power behind the shot, resulting in a catch for Plimmer at deep mid-wicket, who made a commendable grab to her right. Women's T20 World Cup Final Live Score: WICKET! Anneke Bosch falls! WICKET! Melie Kerr and the New Zealand Women's team have struck a significant blow to South Africa's chances in the semifinal. Anneke Bosch, who had been instrumental with the bat for her team, has been dismissed. Kerr, employing a clever strategy, tossed the ball up and pitched it outside the off stump. Bosch, attempting to access the leg side, walked across to the off side and got down on one knee. However, she failed to make contact with the ball as she swiped across the line. Izzy Gaze, the wicketkeeper, and Kerr appealed for the wicket, but the umpire remained unmoved. Convinced of the dismissal, Gaze and Kerr persuaded their captain, Sophie Devine, to opt for a review. The UltraEdge technology revealed a faint spike when the ball passed the bat, confirming Bosch's departure and dealing a significant setback to South Africa's hopes in the crucial match. Women's T20 World Cup Final Live Score: WICKET! Wolvaardt falls! WICKET! Laura Wolvaardt, unable to withstand the mounting pressure from the opposition, attempted to break free from the constraints but unfortunately fell short. Kerr, despite her physical limitations, delivered a full-length delivery around the off-stump, enticing Wolvaardt to attempt an inside-out shot over the cover region. However, Wolvaardt's execution was flawed, as she failed to generate sufficient elevation on the shot, resulting in a flat and direct hit to the strategically placed fielder at extra cover. Suzie Bates, positioned within the ring, made no mistake in securing the catch near her chest, providing New Zealand with a crucial breakthrough. Women's T20 World Cup Final Live Score: WICKET! WICKET! Fran Jonas strikes, Tazmin Brits falls for 17 runs. Staying around the wicket, Jonas cleverly reduces her pace and maintains a persistent length targeting the middle stump.

Against all odds, South Africa managed to secure a crucial wicket in the first over after the break, dismissing the formidable Devine. Women's T20 World Cup Final Live Score: DRINKS BREAK! The final has begun cautiously, with both teams satisfied with their current positions. New Zealand, dealing with the absence of Suzie Bates, finds themselves in a transitional phase.

Suzie Bates regained momentum with a 10-run over but Chloe Tryon slowed things with a 2-run over. Nonkululeko Mlaba found turn, though Bates continued to play with positive intent.
