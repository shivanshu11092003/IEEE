Sometimes, as the song goes, love hurts. And that can be especially true if what you thought was a real relationship turns out to be a con job that costs you a ton of money. Unfortunately, that's the case for the thousands of Americans who fall for   each year. More than 66% of the people polled for a survey released Wednesday by the cybersecurity company Malwarebytes admitted to being targeted by romance scammers, with 10% of the victims reporting that they lost more than $10,000 and 3% saying they lost $100,000 or more. The pulse survey — a short questionnaire — was conducted between Aug. 5 and Aug. 15 and includes responses from 850 readers of Malwarebytes' newsletter from around the world. The survey results track with federal data. Last year, the   received 64,003 reports of romance scams. which accounted for $1.14 billion in losses, with the median loss per victim totaling $2,000. Those numbers may seem staggering, but they probably represent just a fraction of what romance scammers walk away with each year. Experts say many victims never report being scammed because they feel ashamed or don't think coming forward will do any good. Forty percent of those polled in the August survey by Malwarebytes said they never told anyone about being scammed, while just 11% said they reported their crime to law enforcement or a nonprofit group.  Romance scams themselves, also known as pig-butchering scams, are nothing new. Scammers reach out to victims online, often through social media and dating platforms, and strike up an online relationship. They'll often build trust over weeks or even months before asking for money or personal or financial information. Of those polled by Malwarebytes, 26% of victims said their relationship went on for \"an extended period,\" with 12% percent reporting them lasting for several months and 5% saying they communicated with their scammer for a year or more. But once the scammers got what they were looking for they disappeared, and the vast majority of those scammed (94%) said they never recovered the money they lost.  Read on for guidance on how to sidestep a trap.

And while 31 days of online safety might sound ridiculous, it's still a great time to take a hard look at your cybersecurity situation. That means setting strong and unique passwords for all your online accounts, enabling two-factor authentication whenever possible, installing those pesky software security updates and doing your best to keep as much of your private information, well, private. That all may sound daunting, but there's plenty of help out there for those looking for a place to start.

The campaign's website includes helpful tools for consumers, small and medium businesses and all levels of government, CISA director Jen Easterly said in a statement. \"Protecting ourselves online is about taking a few simple, everyday steps to keep our digital lives safe,\" per Easterly. In celebration of Cybersecurity Awareness Month, here are a handful of easy tips from CISA and others to keep your online accounts safe.  need to be long, random and unique. New this year, the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology has  . The latest recommendations state that organizations don't need to require passwords to include a mix of character types. Plus, companies are no longer required to set mandatory time periods for changing passwords, such as every 30 or 90 days. Many security experts had argued that these kinds of requirements were counterproductive because they pointed people towards easily guessed passwords -- think P@$$w0rd or Bree2024!. On the flipside, while NIST still technically requires that companies mandate passwords of at least eight characters, it now recommends requiring passwords with at least 15 characters and up to 64.  Yes, that's a lot of characters, but to make things easier, you can use a passphrase of a handful of unrelated words strung together, such as \"GrandmafootballCheeseburgerhat\" or \"lamppostParisHotsaucetrophyhat.\" Avoid personal details that can easily be guessed or answered by Googling or mining social media. Your dog's name, the model of your first car or the university you graduated from may be important to you, but they're bad password material. Don't recycle your   and use them on multiple accounts -- no matter how good you think they are. That way, you limit the fallout if one of your passwords is compromised. That also goes for the personal questions and answers you use to reset those passwords. Need help? Sign up for a   It'll keep all your logins organized and secure. Using the password generator and manager built into your browser is OK too. While some of those options have been clunky in the past, they've gotten better. For example, you can now use Google's Chrome browser to autofill passwords into apps on an iPhone, as well as auto-generate new ones. If your password does get compromised, a second layer of protection will go a long way toward protecting your account.  , also called MFA, two-factor authentication and two-step verification, requires that someone trying to access your account enter a second form of identification before getting in. MFA works in a host of different ways. It could be a code generated by an app, a biometric like a fingerprint or Face ID, or a   that you insert into your device. Yes, MFA slows down the login process. But if MFA is available, turning it on is a must. One word of warning: If you can, avoid MFA systems that text a code to your smartphone. Why?  , in which cybercriminals steal your phone number by calling your wireless provider and having it switch your number to a new phone and SIM card. It does happen, and if criminals take over your phone number, they'll get that text message too. These days, many cyberattacks and data breaches -- both big and small -- start with a phishing attack. These are scam emails or other kinds of messages that try to trick people into handing over money or personal information under false pretenses. While most of them still show up as emails, phishing also now comes in the form of social media posts,   (smishing) and even   (quishing). These days, phishing is easier than ever thanks to the advent of readily available   like ChatGPT.

It may seem old school at this point, but cybercriminals are still phishing for credit card information. Work-related logins are some of the most sought out by cybercriminals because they could potentially be used to access corporate systems and their data, but even the logins for your personal emails and social media accounts have value. If compromised, they could put you in danger of financial fraud or identity theft, or be used down the road in another scam. To avoid being scammed, experts say, ignore emails and other messages from people and groups you don't know, and don't open any attachments. They could contain computer viruses. If you're concerned about an email's authenticity, pick up the phone and call the person who supposedly sent it. Better yet, help stop phishing by reporting it. If you're concerned about a work email, let your company's IT staff know.

{"title": "\n      Watch Out for Prime Day Scammers When Shopping\n    ", "link": "https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/watch-out-for-these-prime-day-scams/", "date": null, "content": "  \n    Online scammers are looking to take advantage of eager shoppers. Here's how to protect yourself.\n   Watch out for scammers when shopping for Prime Day deals. Amazon's   is here, but shoppers on the hunt for great deals need to be careful that they don't get scammed in the process. Cybercriminals will be looking to use the massive online event as an opportunity to con unwitting shoppers out of their money and personal information. Ahead of the sale, which runs through Wednesday, researchers for the cybersecurity firm Check Point say they've spotted 1,000 new Amazon-related domains over the past 30 days and about 88% of those appear to be potentially malicious or scammy.  While Check Point says many of the sites appear to be \"parked,\" meaning that they're not currently being used for a website or email hosting service, they could be used as part of a phishing scheme. Some of the fake sites are designed to look just like Amazon. Unwitting shoppers reach them when they click on links in phishing emails, SMS messages or ads posted on social media. An example of a scam email spotted by Check Point. That's not exactly shocking. Amazon says scam activity traditionally spikes during the days surrounding Prime Day events. Oftentimes, consumers will receive messages saying that there's a problem with their Amazon account that needs to be fixed right away or they'll risk missing out on those limited-time offers. Other messages might claim that there's a problem shipping an item or are designed to look like an order confirmation for a very expensive item that the customer didn't buy. According to Amazon, nearly half of the impersonation scams reported to it worldwide were fake messages from scammers about fraudulent orders that didn't exist.   Regardless of their specific pitch, the objective of the scams is to steal payment card information or Amazon account usernames and passwords. And that could prove disastrous for shoppers who might not think before they click. An example of a spoofed Amazon website designed to scam consumers. Amazon-related scams aren't relegated to just Prime Day and aren't a new thing.  , Amazon was the second-most impersonated company in 2023. Scammers pretending to be Amazon accounted for 34,000 complaints and $19 million in losses reported to the commission. And it's not just Amazon. Scammers also try to pass themselves off as tech support for companies like Microsoft,  , shipping companies such as UPS and officials from government agencies like the IRS. Security experts say it's Amazon's widespread popularity makes it a top choice for scammers. If a consumer gets an email that looks like it's coming from a bank they don't have an account with, they're probably going to delete it right away. But just about everybody has an Amazon account, making scam emails featuring Amazon significantly more convincing. Outside of the holiday shopping season, Amazon's Prime Day events are some of its biggest sales days of the year and cybercriminals will be looking to capitalize on that. That means shoppers are going to need to be especially on guard as they look for deals.  And many Prime Day offers feature big price cuts and disappear fast, making it more likely that shoppers will click before they think. But that's exactly what they need to do. Here are a handful of tips from Amazon and Check Point for how to stay safe while shopping for Prime Day deals. If a site's address doesn't start with \"Amazon.com,\" it could be a fake. The same goes for other online retailers. Look for misspellings, additional punctuation and anything else that might seem a little off in the address. Amazon will never ask for payment over the phone, by text or by email. It also won't ask you to make them by bank transfer or through a third-party site. You're better off typing in the URL directly than clicking on a link that might be shady. If a message says you ordered something that you think you didn't, skip the link and just check \"My Orders\" in your Amazon account to see if that's true.  Hard-to-crack passwords are musts for all retail sites. That means they need to be long, unique and random. Don't be tempted to recycle even a great password if you've used it for another account. And whenever possible, enable two-factor authentication. Adding this extra form of authentication could save your bacon if your password does end up compromised.  Yes, a lot of Prime Day deals are limited-time, but any offer that says you need to buy right away needs a closer look. Cybercriminals are banking on you clicking before you think. Any legitimate retail site uses SSL encryption by now. It's signified by a lock symbol at the start of the URL. If it's missing, shop elsewhere.  If fraudulent charges show up, you won't be on the hook for the cost.   Most email programs have buttons that let you report spam or phishing. Scam text messages can be reported by forwarding them to 7726 (SPAM). Prime Day scams should be reported to Amazon through their app or  .  Yes, we've heard this so many times it's officially a cliche, but any mind-blowingly amazing deal should be treated like a scam, because it probably is. If you can't verify it on the company's site, steer clear. ", "category": ["phishing", "encryption", "two-factor authentication"]},

Here's some advice from the FTC, CISA and others for how to protect yourself from scammers in the wake of Hurricane Milton. If the message is coming from a person or group you haven't dealt with before, don't respond. Stick to major charitable organizations that you know are legitimate. Go directly to their website.

Admittedly, a lot of people are going to need help fast, but if the experts are right, this is going to be a long rebuilding process. Real charities will happily take your money after you've verified their legitimacy. Criminals, on the other hand, want you to hand it over before you have a chance to think about it.

Pricing for family and business plans is more expensive than individual plans, but family and business plans cover multiple users, while individual plans are limited to a single user.  \n      Cross-platform compatibility\n     Before you purchase a subscription to a password manager, make sure it's compatible with all of the devices, operating systems and browsers you regularly use. The password manager should also automatically sync your passwords and other vault items across all of your devices. \n      Features\n     Make sure your password manager has standard features like multifactor authentication, a password generator, secure sharing and automatic sync. Other useful features to look out for include secure file storage, login autofill, vault health reporting and data breach and dark web monitoring.  \n      Secure sharing capabilities\n     Most password managers include secure sharing features that allow you to safely share vault items with others. Some password managers allow secure sharing only with other users of the same service, while others allow secure sharing with anyone, regardless of whether they use a password manager.  \n      Secure file storage\n     Some password managers offer secure file storage options that allow you to safely store documents like health records, bank statements, insurance paperwork and title documents. Some allow for 1GB of secure storage space, while others may offer up to 10GB. \n      Family plan allowance\n     If you want to share a password manager subscription with family or friends, it's a good move to opt for a password manager family plan. With a family plan, one subscription fee covers anywhere from five to 10 individual accounts, depending on the provider. Simple passwords with your name and a few digits are far too easy to crack these days. The technology used to crack passwords is just too sophisticated, and there’s too much at stake if someone gets a hold of your passwords, so you'll need a way to keep your account logins secure. If you are looking for a reliable way to protect your passwords without the hassle of memorizing them all, a good password manager can help you out. Secure passwords are ideally a complicated and unique combination of letters, numbers and characters. The more secure your password, the tougher it will be to remember. A password manager can generate these for you -- and make them as randomized as you'd like -- and it can eliminate the fear of losing them. You'll still use a master password to log in to your password manager, but it's the only one you'll need to remember. There are a lot of options out there, so CNET tested a dozen of the most popular password managers on the market. Whether you're looking for a free password manager or you're open to spending a little money, we've evaluated everything from encryption to pricing, features, platform compatibility, privacy policies and company history to make picking the best secure password manager easier for you. Based on our rigorous testing,   is currently CNET's top pick for the best password manager, thanks in large part to its commitment to transparency, ease of use and its unbeatable free tier. Bitwarden is a solid choice if you want well-rounded premium password management that's secure, transparent, budget-friendly and easy to use -- or if you want a legitimately unlimited password management solution for free. There is also a desktop app and a mobile app you can use for easy access across all of your devices. Bitwarden scores points for being fully open-source, secure and   by third-party cybersecurity firms, giving it a level of transparency that sets it apart from its peers. Meanwhile, its free plan lets you store an unlimited number of passwords and access them across an unlimited number of devices -- something most free password managers don’t offer. That’s in addition to many top-tier features like secure password sharing, encrypted vault export and a username and password generator. If you’d rather opt for a premium plan, Bitwarden offers full vault health reports, 1GB file storage, emergency access (where you can designate a trusted contact to access your vault in case of an emergency), Bitwarden authenticator and advanced multifactor authentication with YubiKey, FIDO2 and Duo. Premium plans are budget-friendly at $10 per year for individuals and $40 per year for families, which allows for up to six users. 1Password is a breeze to use on all your devices and includes some handy extras. The user interface is slick and intuitive, and its autofill functionality works seamlessly. Sharing passwords and other vault items with others is also simple, even if the people you’re sharing them with aren’t 1Password users. One stand-out feature is Travel Mode. When activated, vault items that you haven't marked as \"Safe for Travel\" will be temporarily erased from the app on all of your devices. This helps keep particularly sensitive login information or financial information inaccessible to any authorities who may ask you to unlock your device for inspection. 1Password is slightly on the more expensive side at $36 per year for individual users or $60 per year for families. While you won’t find a free plan, 1Password includes a 14-day free trial. Like other top password managers, Keeper lets you store and sync an unlimited number of vault items across an unlimited number of devices. Keeper offers apps for MacOS, Windows, Linux, iOS and Android, along with an extension for popular internet browsers including Chrome, Firefox, Safari and Brave. I like Keeper’s “offline mode,” which allows you to access your vault items even if you're somewhere with zero or limited internet access.  Standard pricing is $35 per year for individuals and $75 per year for a family of five, which is on the expensive side. A free plan is available if you don’t want to pay for a subscription, but it’s basically useless because it limits access to a single mobile device and 10 passwords. You’re better off going with Bitwarden if you want a legitimate free password manager. Alternatively, you can try Keeper’s premium tier before fully committing thanks to its generous 30-day free trial. NordPass is well-designed, easy to navigate and works seamlessly across all platforms. The free version lets you store an unlimited number of vault items across all of your devices, and you get access to additional basic features like a password generator, advanced multi-factor authentication,   and automatic sync. If you’re on the free plan, you can use it on as many devices as you like, but you can only be logged into a single device at a time -- which is a moderate inconvenience, but I appreciate that NordPass lets you access your passwords on an unlimited number of devices nonetheless.  With a premium plan, you can be logged into as many devices as you’d like. Paid users also have access to password health reports, data breach scanner and monitoring, secure sharing, emergency access and the ability to attach files to vault items totaling up to 3GB. Individual premium plans cost $28 for the first year (renews at $35 annually thereafter) or $43 for the first two years combined (then $35 annually). If you opt for the family plan, you’ll get six premium user accounts for $44 for the first year (then $72 annually) or $67 for the first two years combined (then $72 annually). While Dashlane's password generator isn't quite as robust as what others offer, it works well and offers sufficient options for customization. Premium plans also include access to a virtual private network from  , a middling VPN that falls short of cracking our list of  . Dashlane’s free plan used to allow for unlimited passwords on one device but now   on a single device -- which is slightly more generous than Kepper’s 10 password limit but just as useless. Premium plans allow for an unlimited number of passwords on an unlimited number of devices but are decisively pricier than the competition (while delivering a lesser product). Individual plans cost $60 per year, which is more expensive than some of its rivals’ family plans. Dashlane's family plan covers up to 10 users, but for most people, 10 users is probably overkill and not worth the steep $90-per-year cost. Perhaps Dashlane’s high cost can be attributed to the fact that a VPN is included in the price, but you’re better off getting a quality VPN and a cheaper password manager separately than getting HotspotShield bundled with your Dashlane subscription. With the numerous password manager options available, it can be overwhelming to choose the right one. CNET has thoroughly tested dozens of password managers over the years, and we've developed a pretty good idea of the types of things to look for in a quality service. Here are the most important things to consider when choosing a password manager: You're putting a ton of trust in your password manager to keep your logins safe, so the security of the service should be your top concern. Look for a password manager that operates on a zero-knowledge basis and secures user vaults with industry-standard AES 256-bit encryption. Independent security audits can also help bolster trust in a password manager. While you're researching password managers, it's important to consider the company behind the service. Has the company been involved in any security incidents that have potentially compromised user data? If so, it's best to look elsewhere.   Pricing for password managers can vary from provider to provider, so you'll want to pick a service that will fit your needs and budget. Most password managers have pricing plans for individuals, families and businesses. Pricing for family and business plans is more expensive than individual plans, but family and business plans cover multiple users, while individual plans are limited to a single user. Many password managers also offer free tiers, but they almost always come with limitations on features or device allowance. Some services, like Bitwarden, allow for unlimited vault entries on unlimited devices on their free plan. Most password managers also offer either a free trial or a money-back guarantee, so you can try them risk-free.    One of the most important aspects of using a password manager is having it available on all of the devices you use. Before you purchase a subscription to a password manager, make sure it's compatible with all of the devices, operating systems and browsers you regularly use. The password manager should also automatically sync your passwords and other vault items across all of your devices. This helps ensure that you can access your passwords at any time from any of your devices.  Make sure your password manager has standard features like multifactor authentication, a password generator, secure sharing and automatic sync. Other useful features to look out for include secure file storage, login autofill, vault health reporting and data breach and dark web monitoring. Many password managers also allow you to store things like credit card numbers, bank account numbers, health data, PIN codes and secure notes in addition to storing your online login credentials.   It's never a good idea to share passwords or other highly sensitive information via email or SMS, but most password managers include secure sharing features that allow you to safely share vault items with others. Some password managers allow secure sharing only with other users of the same service, while others allow secure sharing with anyone, regardless of whether they use a password manager. Secure sharing features are also typically customizable and allow you to set restrictions on how many times a shared vault item can be accessed or for how long. If you're planning on sharing certain passwords with family members, friends or colleagues, it's a good idea to check on the password manager's secure sharing capabilities to ensure they suit your security needs.     Some password managers offer secure file storage options that allow you to safely store documents like health records, bank statements, insurance paperwork and title documents. Some allow for 1GB of secure storage space, while others may offer up to 10GB. Depending on whether you need to store files and how much space you would need, it's a good idea to look into the secure file storage capabilities and allowances of the password manager you're considering. If you want to share a password manager subscription with family or friends, it's a good move to opt for a password manager family plan. With a family plan, one subscription fee covers anywhere from five to 10 individual accounts, depending on the provider. A family plan is a convenient and cost-effective option for anyone who wants to easily and securely share vault items with trusted contacts. The most important consideration for any password manager is the security of the product, so we look at what encryption standards it uses, whether it's a zero-knowledge service and whether it has been independently audited.  We carefully examine each provider's privacy policy to get a sense of what personal data is collected from users and how that data is secured. We examine the provider's pricing and check whether a free version is available. We also test how the password manager performed across platforms, devices and operating systems. We test the services' multi-factor authentication, password generator and secure sharing features and evaluate the overall look and feel of the UI, including monitoring and password health reporting, if applicable. Enpass is unique in that it doesn't have centralized servers that store your data. You can either store your vault on your devices themselves or in your personal cloud storage like Dropbox or iCloud. That makes it a great option for anyone who wants complete control over the storage of their password manager vaults. On the downside, the app is a bit outdated and clunky but still fully functional. KeePass is completely open source and completely free. It's a powerful password manager but geared primarily toward the techie crowd. Regular people may find the interface outdated and cumbersome to navigate compared with those of other password managers. Apple launched a new Passwords app with the release of iOS 18 in September. While it’s a step up from the basic functionality offered by iCloud Keychain, Passwords is still rather barebones and mostly only useful for Apple users. That said, Apple’s Passwords app is a secure and convenient place to store your passwords, passkeys, authentication codes and Wi-Fi network passwords across your Apple devices. I like the app’s Security section that alerts you if it detects any compromised or reused passwords. You can also securely share passwords and passkeys with trusted contacts. The Passwords app is only available for iPhone, iPad and Apple Vision Pro, but you can leverage iCloud Keychain to access your passwords on a Mac or PC. If you’re looking for a password manager that you can use for the long term for free, then it needs to offer two things for it to be worth it: strong zero-knowledge encryption and auto-syncing of unlimited passwords across unlimited devices.  Having access to all of your passwords across all of your devices is the foundation of your password manager’s effectiveness. You’ll be able to easily get to all of your (strong and unique) account passwords wherever you are and on any device you have on hand, which can reduce the temptation to take the unsafe route of using the same easy to remember password across all of your online logins. If the free password manager you’re using can only be used on one device and for only a handful of passwords, then it’s practically useless beyond just giving you a preview of what you can expect the software’s paid tier look and feel to be like. A free password manager typically won’t include advanced features like detailed vault health reports, data breach scanning and encrypted file attachments, but if all you need is a safe place to store all of your passwords that you can access from all of your devices, then there are a few options. I recommend using Bitwarden if you want a legitimate unlimited free password manager that you can use for the long term. It’s one of the few password managers that offers a free tier that delivers core password manager features -- plus a few extras -- at no cost. Bitwarden is the most secure password manager right now thanks to its zero knowledge end-to-end AES-CBC 256-bit encryption, excellent security features and annual independent security audits. And while many other password manager apps are closed-source, Bitwarden is fully open-source, meaning that its entire source code is publicly available for anyone to scrutinize. Bitwarden also operates a Security and Compliance Program that defines policies “that govern security practices and processes and are continually updated to be consistent with applicable legal, industry, and regulatory requirements,” according to its  . Yes, security experts recommend using a password manager as an effective way to maintain the security of your online accounts. Weak and reused passwords can make it easy for bad actors to gain access to your accounts, potentially leading to consequences like identity theft or financial loss. But security experts recommend password managers because they can create and store unique, complex passwords that make it exponentially more difficult for anyone to crack your account logins. Security experts also like password managers because they can monitor the dark web for potentially compromised credentials, notify users of data breaches and even help guard against phishing attacks by not autofilling passwords into suspected phishing sites. After signing up for a password manager, you'll be prompted to create a master password. Your master password should be a strong password or passphrase that you can remember but haven't used for any other logins. The master password is the one password you need to access your password manager vault. The next step is to download the app or browser extension to the devices you plan to use the service on. You can also opt to use the web-based user interface if you prefer (if offered by the service you choose). Once you've signed up and gotten acquainted with the app, start adding passwords and other vault items you want to keep secure. If you have passwords stored in a web browser or other password manager, you can easily import them to the new password manager. You also can manually enter the login credentials, or you can have your password manager automatically save your credentials when you log into one of your online accounts. Once you've got your passwords saved, you can use your password manager to autofill the login credentials for the accounts you have stored in your vault. Password managers are extremely attractive targets for cybercriminals -- and yes, they can be hacked. All of the password managers listed above operate on a zero-knowledge approach to password management, meaning that not even the company storing your vault data can decrypt the information contained within. Only the user can decrypt and access their vault. Similarly, the password managers featured above don't have access to your master password.  All of this makes it difficult for an attacker to gain access to the passwords and other items in your vault. In the case of the 2022 LastPass breach, attackers were able to steal encrypted user vaults. So all the attacker would need to do is crack the master password for a stolen vault to access everything inside, which would be an easy task if the master password is weak. The best way to protect your data in case of a similar breach is to create a strong master password. A strong password should ideally be a minimum of 12 characters. You can also create passphrases that consist of randomly strung-together words. The best password managers offer customizable password generators that you can use to create truly random passwords and passphrases based on the criteria you select. The longer and more complex the password or passphrase, the better. There are a few legitimate free password manager options for anyone who wants to securely store their passwords without paying a dime. Bitwarden is CNET's recommendation for the best free password manager. NordPass is another solid option. And if you're more technically inclined, you can go with KeePass, which is completely free and unlimited but not as easy to use as many others.  But if you want all the bells and whistles included in a premium, paid password manager, there are some budget friendly options priced between $10 and $30 per year. LastPass is one of the most well-known and popular password managers on the market. In light of its lengthy history of security incidents -- including the   in which an \"unauthorized party\" stole customer account information and sensitive vault data -- CNET can't in good conscience recommend LastPass to our readers. While the company says it’s since boosted security, the alarming nature of that latest data breach has severely undermined trust in LastPass products. CNET will conduct a thorough re-review of the service in the future, after which we will reevaluate whether LastPass should return to our list of best password managers. In the meantime, you can turn to any of the password managers featured above.", "category": ["data breach", "phishing", "encryption", "identity theft", "dark web"]}
